The parts to care about:
The main class where the game loop is executed is the Game class (Game.h and Game.cpp).
The function UpdateLogic and DrawFrame are called each frame in that order
so this is where anything you want drawn or updated should be placed. The difference
between these functions is purely organizational, anything that updates 
any object on screen should be placed in UpdateLogic and DrawFrame should only
contain draw commands. This way objects are updated before being drawn. 

##########################
Getting user input:
The way to detect button or mouse pressed is by using wnd.mouse and wnd.keyboard respectively
The basic way you would detect if a button is being pressed is 
	if(wnd.kbd.KeyIsPressed('L'))
	{ actions }
